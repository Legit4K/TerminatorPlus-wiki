# Introduction

## Plugin Description

**TerminatorPlus** is a **Spigot** **Plugin** that allows the creation of server-side player bots. Unlike many NPC plugins that already exist, this project has an emphasis on making the bots as human-like as possible.

## Supported Versions

During the Beta phase, Minecraft Server Version **1.16.5** is the single compatible version. 1.17 support will _likely_ roll out in the first stable release. **Major forks of Spigot 1.16.5 are also compatible!**

{% hint style="success" %}
### You can choose to run the plugin on a 1.16.5 server and use the [ViaVersion Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) to allow 1.17 players to play at the same time!
{% endhint %}
