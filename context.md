# Additional Info

## Explanations

* **Spigot**

> Spigot is a well known Minecraft Server Software. There are many more such as Paper, Tuinity and Purpur which are forks of Spigot which means that they are based on Spigot.

* **NPC**

> NPCs are Non Player Characters. In the context of this plugin, NPC is simply another name for Bot. You can call it an alias.

* **Alias**

> An Alias is an alternative name for something. For example, some commands have aliases so you can run the same function with different command names.

* **Server**

> In the context of this plugin, the server is the Multiplayer Game Session that can be hosted on your PC or dedicated hosting providers. The Plugin cannot run outside of a server!

* **Plugin**

> A Plugin is an addon that communicates with the server software to extend functionality. TerminatorPlus is an excellent example.

* **Mod**

> Mods are amazing extensions to expand the capabilities of the Minecraft Game itself. They communicate and sometimes modify part of the **Client** to achieve this. Mods are not the same as Plugins so in this sense, **TerminatorPlus is not a Mod!**

* **Source Code**

> The Source Code is the essence of software, plugins and mods. It is the building blocks of TerminatorPlus and much more cool things!
