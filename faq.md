# Frequently Asked Questions

### How Does It Work?

TerminatorPlus works as a **server plugin** that integrates with NMS and the Spigot API enabling the plugin to access methods that allow us to create a custom entity, in this case, a highly customizable bot designed to hunt gamers like you or your neighbour next door.



### Can I use this in singleplayer?

Simple answer, no. TerminatorPlus is a **Spigot Plugin** for the time being. However, the possibility of expanding into a Standalone bot could potentially be looked at in the future.



### How do I train the bot?

You can start a training session using the `/ai reinforcement <size> <name> [skin]` command. The current method of training is population-based allowing the bots to combat with duplicates of themselves repeatedly to improve their decision making.



### Why should I train the bot?

To be completely honest, right now, you probably shouldn't. Their neural nets \(ai, mind of the bot\) are currently stored in server memory so all the training progress will be lost upon server close. Eventually their neural networks will be "saved to disk" \(storage\) which should allow your bots to evolve into some beefy killing machines.



### How do I give the bot \[X\]?
