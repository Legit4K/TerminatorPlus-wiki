## Versioning Scheme

{% hint style="info" %}
#### The Plugin is currently in Beta and follows a basic form of Semantic Versioning. 3.0-BETA was the first public version released to the public
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### I offer Alpha versions to give users early access to things I'm working on, however they may not always be merged into the beta by HorseNuggets.
