## Versioning Scheme

{% hint style="info" %}
#### The Plugin is currently in Beta and follows a basic form of Semantic Versioning. 3.0-BETA was the first public version released to the public
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### I offer Alpha versions to give users early access to things I'm working on, however they may not always be merged into the beta by HorseNuggets.
{% endhint %}

### Port Forwarding

This can be a complicated step for many people which is why I'm recommending a simple solution that handles this all for you and even automatically updates the IPs whenever ur router changes them. [**Check it out here!**](https://www.noip.com/remote-access/minecraft)\*\*\*\*

### Installing Java

Generally, you'll want to be using Java 11 or potentially even Java 16 depending on the server software you choose. Make sure to [**read this guide**](https://paper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/java-update/index.html) for a short tutorial on choosing your Java Version.



### Server Softwares

#### [Paper](https://papermc.io/api/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.16.5/builds/788/downloads/paper-1.16.5-788.jar)

> A high performance fork of Spigot that is generally a good choice for most Minecraft 1.16.5 Servers.

#### [Tuinity](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Spottedleaf/job/Tuinity/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/tuinity-paperclip.jar)

> An even more optimized fork designed for high player count servers.

#### [Spigot](https://cdn.getbukkit.org/spigot/spigot-1.16.5.jar)

> That one server software that nearly everything is based on. Get's the job done but not recommend for production use.
